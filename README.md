# Digital-Music-Store-Database-Project
**Project Description** <br/>
This was a final project of Using SQL for Data Analysis Course. The project was aimed to analyze the Chinbook database to understand their customers, employees, media and invoice information. In this project, you must prepare and analyze the data by using your SQL skills, like (joins, subqueries, views, aliases, aggregations, etc.), and sharing the findings as a presentation that explaining the most important insights. I spent almost 5 days on this project, it was useful and challenging. <br/>
<br/>
**Getting Dataset** <br/>
In this project, I used the _Chinbook Database_, that contains 11 tables, each table has a lot of rows and values. You can get the data through the files which I uploaded in this repository. The name of the database is chinbook-db. <br/>
<br/>
**Project Requirements** <br/>
For the this project, I conducted five Tasks: <br/>
1. Creating creative questions about the digital music store data. <br/>
2. Creating SQL queries that answering your questions. <br/>
3. Pulling the data and transform it, to be able to use in spreadsheet softwares, like (Excel). 
4. Using these data to design visualizations describing your answers visually. <br/>
5. Sharing the findings, by building a presentation in which explain what the data you have, and what the insights you explored. <br/>
